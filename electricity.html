      <p class="quote">The pressure at the end of the hose can represent voltage. The water in the tank represents charge. The more water in the tank, the higher the charge, the more pressure is measured at the end of the hose.</p>

      <p class="quote">We measure the same amount of pressure at the end of either hose, but when the water begins to flow, the flow rate of the water in the tank with the narrower hose will be less than the flow rate of the water in the tank with the wider hose. In electrical
        terms, the current through the narrower hose is less than the current through the wider hose</p>

      <p class="quote">If we want the flow to be the same through both hoses, we have to increase the amount of water (charge) in the tank with the narrower hose.</p>
      <p class="quote">This increases the pressure (voltage) at the end of the narrower hose, pushing more water through the tank. This is analogous to an increase in voltage that causes an increase in current.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <p class="quote">Now we're starting to see the relationship between voltage and current. But there is a third factor to be considered here: the width of the hose. In this analogy, the width of the hose is the resistance. This means we need to add another term to
        our model:
        <ul>
          <li>Water = Charge (measured in Coulombs)</li>
          <li>Pressure = Voltage (measured in Volts)</li>
          <li>Flow = Current (measured in Amperes, or "Amps" for short)</li>
          <li>Hose Width = Resistance</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="quote">It stands to reason that we can't fit as much volume through a narrow pipe than a wider one at the same pressure. This is resistance. The narrow pipe "resists" the flow of water through it even though the water is at the same pressure as the tank
        with the wider pipe.</p>

      <p class="quote">In electrical terms, this is represented by two circuits with equal voltages and different resistances. The circuit with the higher resistance will allow less charge to flow, meaning the circuit with higher resistance has less current flowing through
        it.

      <p class="quote">This circular path, which is always required to get electricity to flow and do something useful, is called a circuit. A circuit is a path that starts and stops at the same place, which is exactly what we're doing.</p>

      <h3>More Current Equals More Light</h3>
      <p class="quote">The brightness of an LED is directly dependent on how much current it draws. That means two things. The first being that super bright LEDs drain batteries more quickly, because the extra brightness comes from the extra power being used. The second
        is that you can control the brightness of an LED by controlling the amount of current through it. But, setting the mood isn't the only reason to cut back your current.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h3>There is Such a Thing as Too Much Power</h3>
      <p class="quote">If you connect an LED directly to a current source it will try to dissipate as much power as it's allowed to draw, and, like the tragic heroes of olde, it will destroy itself. That's why it's important to limit the amount of current flowing across
        the LED. For this, we employ resistors. Resistors limit the flow of electrons in the circuit and protect the LED from trying to draw too much current.</p>
