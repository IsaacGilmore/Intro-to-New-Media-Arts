    <p class="notice">This schedule is subject to modification. Activities are subject to change based on the progression of the course. No due dates / readings / homework will be changed without prior notification in class.</p>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Introduction to New Media Arts is a studio based course which provides an overview of the theories and practices of New Media Arts. Students will learn fundamental practices of electronic arts including but not limited to circuit design, basic to
      intermediate electronics, and programming for interactivity. Through hands on workshops, students will explore basic electronic techniques and use of programmable microcontrollers (Arduino) to control interactive art, sound, light, and environments.
      Students will also be introduced to and are encouraged to draw inspiration from various artists and their work through lectures rooted in the history, theory, and current practices of responsive and new media art.</p>
    <p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
    <p class="notice">**Having your own computer is a requirement for this class**</p>
    <h2>ASSIGNMENTS</h2>
    <p>There will be a series of assignments throughout the semester that utilize thoughtful and creative applications of electronics in the arts. Students will draw from personal experience, class readings, lectures, and tutorials as inspiration for their
      work. All assignments are DUE on their respective due dates. Documentation is also required for each assignment for individual portfolios. See the Assignments and Readings pages on the class blog for information.</p>
    <h2>READING MATERIALS</h2>
    <p>Various articles and excerpts from journals, conferences, and books covering topics such as critical theory, experimental new media art, and computer graphics will be handed out in class as reading assignments.</p>
    <p>Suggested readings and supplemental materials can be found under the <a href="readings.html">Readings</a> section of this site. There are no required books you need to purchase for this class.</p>
    <h2>GRADING</h2>
    <p>Grading is based on expectations of class participation, reading responses, and quality of work created.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">10% In Class Participation:</span> Class participation includes lab time, workshops, critiques, discussions, and an overall active engagement in class.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">30% Assignments:</span> These assignments will be discussed in class and will be posted on the course website with adequate time for completion.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">40% Final:</span> The final project will consist of an artistic work or installation of your choosing utilizing the skills obtained in lab exercises and inspired by course content. Please see the homework and assignments section
      for details.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">10% Homework:</span> There will also be a few short homework exercises for you to complete throughout the semester. Information for each homework assignment will be given in class and listed on the class schedule.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">10% Portfolio: </span>As part of each assignment, students are expected to hand in documentation. At the end of the semester, you will hand in a completed portfolio of the semester’s work. Portfolios are helpful tools for analyzing
      your work outside of class and are useful for portfolio reviews (for art majors). Getting used to creating a portfolio and creating good documentation of work is an important aspect of professional art making.</p>
    <p>Assignments submitted after the due date will be penalized one letter grade. No assignments will be accepted for credit later than one week beyond the due date.</p>
    <h2>ATTENDANCE</h2>
    <p>Attendance is mandatory. Lectures and demos will start at the beginning of class, so it is important that you be punctual. Latecomers are disruptive to class, be considerate and show up on time.</p>
    <p>Students are expected to utilize work time during class productively. If a student leaves class early without approval from the instructor, they will be marked as absent or tardy – even if it is a “work in class” day or the instructor’s lecture is
      completed before the class period ends.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-Three absences &#8211; no penalty except for loss of instruction</li>
      <li>Four absences &#8211; grade lowered one letter grade
      </li>
      <li>Five absences &#8211; grade lowered an additional letter grade.</li>
      <li>Six absences &#8211; automatic failure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Three late arrivals or early departures are counted as one absence</p>
    <p>If you are absent on critique days, you will be marked down one letter grade. Critiques are an important part of class and you’ll have to show your work eventually.</p>
    <h2>LAB POLICIES</h2>
    <p>There is a required laboratory fee for this course, which is used for course materials and supplies that you can keep.</p>
    <p>Eating or drinking must be kept clear of the workspaces. Only drink using a closed container.</p>
    <p>Never eat or drink while soldering!</p>
    <p>Please be considerate and clean up after yourself! This includes empty drinks, all small pieces of plastic, and misc. clippings. This is a shared lab space and we need everyone’s help to keep it clean and in order.</p>
    <h2>LAB HOURS</h2>
    <p>The New Media Lab has hours available for students to work on projects outside of normal class time. Lab assistants are available to give advice and troubleshooting help. Lab hours will be posted on the New Media Lab door.</p>
    <h2>IN CLASS PHONE/LAPTOP POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      Use of cell phones, laptops, iPads, etc. for texting, email, chatting, internet browsing, or any activity unrelated to what we are doing in class at that moment is a distraction to yourself and others in the class. Any student warned about inappropriate
      personal digital device usage more than twice in one class will be marked late for this day.
    </p>
    <h2>ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES</h2>
    <p>Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of University life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical
      environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community. UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability
      community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
    <p>For additional information or assistance with the equal opportunity, affirmative action, and harassment policies and procedures of the University of Illinois at Chicago, please contact the <a href="http://oae.uic.edu/">Office for Access and Equity</a>.
      During the first week of the semester, a student needing accommodations for any type of disability should make an appointment with the instructor to schedule a meeting to discuss the situation and possible solutions.</p>
    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Do not leave personal belongings, cameras, equipment or other valuables unattended as this is an open access building and there have occasionally been incidents of theft. Do not prop open doors when they are locked after regular hours, especially
      the main door to the building. Consider instead posting a note or texting so a visitor can call to let you know of his/her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>If you see a suspicious person who does not seem to be School student or faculty, call UIC Police and ask them to check on the situation. There are red “Call Police” buttons positioned throughout the building.
    </p>
    <p>UIC POLICE NUMBER: 1-312-355-5555 or 312-996-2830</p>
    <h2>SHARED SPACE</h2>
    <p>As a member of the UIC Art community, you have 24-hour access to the studios and other spaces. Please treat the spaces with respect. Clean up if you mess up tables, walls, or floor with food or art supplies. Throw away your trash after class each
      day. If the spaces in studios, hallways or other areas are changed by an art installation or work process you are responsible for restoring space to original conditions. For the safety of fellow students as well as equipment and spaces do not prop
      open doors or allow unauthorized people to enter the building.</p>
    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>Projects created in this course may be used by the Department for purposes of promotion for students, the Department, or the University in general. The Department may also use these materials for instructional purposes in future courses. The Instructor
      may also use your projects as examples of work completed in the class.</p>
