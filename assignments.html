        <h3 id="processing">Processing Project</h3>
        <p>Using Processing, create a drawing machine/program that uses mouse input/interaction and at least one for loop and one conditional statement. You can visualize whatever you want, but try to not to simply copy and paste code from various sketches…understanding
          what the code is doing is super important </p>
        <h4>Requirements & Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>At least one example of mouse interaction</li>
          <li>At least one for loop</li>
          <li>At least one conditional statment</li>
          <li>Submit code and one image from your sketch to instructor</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="creative">Creative Switch</h3>
        <p>This assignment explores your ability to use your newfound electronic knowledge to create a custom switch. Using materials that have not previously used or demonstrated in class, create your own switch or button. This can be a soft circuit button,
          out of materials found at home, etc. A good example is wiring a zipper to turn on LED’s. We will be going over several examples of unconventional switches. Use your switch to turn on at least 2 LED’s (you may use more LEDs if desired). Or, you
          can make two switch circuits that each light one LED. This assignment may be turned in as “bare bones” or on a circuit board with exposed wires.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The emphasis here is on creating small sculptures or design objects, which incorporate an original or unique switch method that you design</li>
          <li>You should spend a good amount of time on brainstorming and on construction. The components of the circuit may be relatively simple - it's really the mechanics of the switch (how it opens and closes) that will be your 'ingenious' solution</li>
          <li>You may collaborate with another student in the class (with instructor approval) on the assignment - but the work will be expected to be more complex than a project by one student wokring alone</li>
          <li><em>The switch should be functional</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Requirements & Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Completion of assignment for in-class critique</li>
          <li>Build a creative switch using a method not demonstrated in class</li>
          <li>Turn on a minimum of 2 LEDs</li>
          <li>Documentation: 5 images of your piece to be submitted (in 'Instructables' format) on due date of project. This should include:
            <ul>
              <li>parts list</li>
              <li>image descriptions</li>
              <li>construction explanation</li>
              <li>function explanation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The class should be able to construct and understand the switch by using your post as a guide.</li>

        <h3 id="interactive">Interactive Project</h3>
        <p>This assignment aims to explore the intersection of electronics, programming, and the body. These interactive explorations can express the functional and conceptual potentials within the context of technology and the human body. Projects may be
          inspired by topics such as data collection, personal communication, pure dynamic aesthetics, assistive devices, emotive or expressive objects, the relationship between technology and the body, and medical technologies.</p>
        <h4>Requirements & Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Must use Arduino and follow guidelines above</li>
          <li>Complection of project ofr in-class critique</li>
          <li>Documentation: 5 images of your piece to be submitted (in 'Instructables' format) on due date of project. This should include:
            <li>Include your Arduino code in your submission</li>

        <h3 id="final">Final Project</h3>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Part I</h4>
          <p>A typed 1-2 page proposal with a drawing, sketch, or model (with approximate dimensions) attached for your final project due via email. Your sketches/drawings/models should help you communicate your idea. In your one page proposal, please discuss
            what you would like to work on for your final project, why you want to produce this piece, and your conceptual reasoning behind wanting to create the work. Please include a list of parts and materials that you think you might need to execute
            this project with prices so you can adequately anticipate your budget and links to sources, and a timeline you can commit to for completion of the project. You will each meet with me individually to discuss your final projects on April 10th
            to gain approval to begin working on project and to receive feedback to help you find parts and give you conceptual feedback and other helpful resources.</p>
          <h4>Deliverables</h4>
          <p>1-2 page proposal including:
            <ul>
              <li>Drawing/sketch/model</li>
              <li>List of parts/materials needed with budget</li>
              <li>Sources</li>
              <li>Timeline for completion</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Part II</h4>
          <p>In consultation with the instructor, develop a final project that shows significant mastery of topics and exercises covered in the course, utilizing the skills obtained in lab exercises and inspired by course content . The final project will
            consist of this artistic work accompanied by a minimum 2-3 page paper and short presentation of your project in class. The project may be of any kind of experimental art piece, interactive sculpture, wearable, or responsive installation and
            is up to your design. The piece may also be an expansion of a previously attempted project from the course so long as it is sufficiently advanced. This can be a collaborative project, however, collaboration must be pre-approved. Be prepared
            to have ideas in mind for your final project in mind by the 12th week of the course. I know this sounds early but bear in mind you will need to order electronic parts and will need time to construct and work out kinks. I am open to you coming
            up with creative ways to execute your projects so please feel free to ask questions or suggest ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be graded on the creativity and functionality of your piece as well as your 2-3 page paper and final presentation during our final class critique. Your paper should discuss the work that you have produced. Please be sure to conceptually discuss
            your reasoning for your final piece as well as any inspirations that may have lead you to create the work and any other information you find important to your final project.
          </p>
          <h4>Requirements & Deliverables</h4>

        <h3 id=portfolio>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>As part of each assignment, students are expected to hand in documentation. At the end of the semester, you will hand in a completed portfolio of the semester’s work. Portfolios are helpful tools for analyzing your work outside of class and are
          useful for portfolio reviews (for art majors). Getting used to creating a portfolio and creating good documentation of work is an important aspect of professional art making. Your portfolio should include documenation from each assignment completed
          in the course submitted to the instructor as a PDF.</p>
